      <p>So this'll be my first post. A little about myself. Used to study information security had a job at Infosys for a while
        before quitting to pursue engineering and art. Definitely a non-traditional path. Not even sure about the art thing really.
        Just something I've always been interested in.
        <br>
        28 years old, based in NY.
        <br>
        Setting up a daily routine for myself to be more productive and consistent. That'll be good for me. I'll be updating this daily.
        <br>
        Currently working at a Japanese restaraunt. It's not bad. The pay is decent and the people are nice. But it's not what I want to do long term.
        Feeling good though considering what I've been through. I think I'm on the right path now. I mean are we?

        Got up on time. Worked out. Ate something that didn't make me tired which is a win.
        <br>
        Gotta take care of some personal stuff today. But I think I'll be able to get some work done too later.
        <br>
        Will update later. Stay frosty.

        Demotivated. But I guess that's normal. Just gotta push through it.
        <br>
        So much to learn. But I guess that's the fun part right? Don't know where to start.

         Nevermind the demotivation. I got this. It's all in the mind. Updating this at work. Was studying some basic electrical engineering concepts last night / this morning. Going to get at this.
